    <h2>About SAMBAVis</h2>

    <p>SAMBAVis is an open-source visual analytics tool focused on time-oriented and user-generated content. The online tool is powered by user comments from YouTube music videos. From these comments, we produce extra data analytics, such as sentiment analysis and keyword extraction. SAMBAVis will allow you to assess the main key performance indexes of music videos, their life cycle, the how users engage with these videos and their comments.</p>

    <h3>The SAMBA Project</h3>
    <p>SAMBAVis was developed as part of the research project <a href="https://research.fhstp.ac.at/projekte/samba-smart-data-for-music-business-administration">SAMBA (smart data for music business administration)</a> from the University of Applied Sciences St. Pölten (St. Pölten UAS). The goal of SAMBA is to explore the economic value of social media data for the music industry. The Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) funds the SAMBA project within the funding line COIN Aufbau (capacity building). </p>

    <h2>Analytics and Visualizations</h2>

    <p>SAMBAVis is organized in cards. Each card contains its own set of controls and an info tooltip. After adding a video or group of videos to the dashboard, you can navigate through different analytics by using the menu on the top of the page.</p>
    <img alt="SAMBA Vis" class="helpImg" src="../../assets/help/cardmenu.png" title="Cards group different analytics, which are available through the main menu."/>
    <p>Each page has four main cards: Selected Videos, Time View, Overview, and Comments.</p>

    <h3>Selected Videos</h3>
    <p>The first card on the top-left side of the page shows the selected videos and their main key performance indexes (e.g. views, comments, likes, and dislikes). You can remove videos from the dashboard by clicking the corresponding close button in the list of videos.</p>
    <img alt="SAMBA Vis" class="helpImg" src="../../assets/help/hardfacts.png" title="Selected videos card and its KPIs." />

    <h3>Time View</h3>
    <p>The second card on the top-right side is larger and displays the number of comments from the selected videos over time. When selecting other analytics in the main menu, the content of this card changes to display the corresponding analytics over time.</p>
    <img alt="SAMBA Vis" class="helpImg" src="../../assets/help/time.png" title="Time view cards." />

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The third card on the bottom-left side displays an overview of the main analytics. It can be the main keywords (topics) from the comments, or the main sentiment or language for each video. When hovering the bar charts, a tooltip shows the main results for each video.</p>
    <img alt="SAMBA Vis" class="helpImg" src="../../assets/help/overview.png" title="Overview cards." />

    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>The fourth card on the bottom-right side of the screen shows the comments. You can expand the card to navigate through the comments. You can request a different number of comments, filter, see replies, and go to the corresponding comment on the YouTube page.</p>
    <img alt="SAMBA Vis" class="helpImg" src="../../assets/help/comments.png" title="Comments card. It is collapsible to present the comments on demand." />
    
    <h3>Time Filter</h3>
    <p>Filters connect the visualizations on different cards. Thus, you can use the slider on the time visualizations to filter comments and overviews by time. To remove the filters, you can use the button “reset filters” in the time visualization card.</p>
    <img alt="SAMBA Vis" class="helpImg" src="../../assets/help/timefilter.png" title="Time filter. By moving the slider under the time view, it applies the filter to every other card." />

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <ul class="helpList">
      <li><b>How to find a music video with SAMBAVis?</b><br/>A button on the top left side is used to search and add videos to the dashboard. Users can search by song or artist, and add videos or a group of videos from different channels corresponding to the same song. Cards in the search drawer display information about the found videos, their key performance indexes (KPIs), and a link to the original video on YouTube.</li>
      <li><b>Why the song I want to select is not available?</b><br/>User comments from pre-selected videos are retrieved via YouTube API every night. Then, metadata about videos, users, comments, and replies, as well as text mining results, are stored in our database. Finally, charts summarize the results in SAMBAVis. To insert new videos in the database, please contact us.</li>
      <li><b>What does "topics" mean?</b><br/>The topics card shows the most frequent words in the comments (i.e. keywords). A word cloud provides an overview while lists provide details of the main keywords for each selected video. Keywords are colored according to the sentiment of the comment they were extracted from.</li>
      <li><b>How can a filter a certain time?</b><br/>In the main time visualization, the number of comments can be aggregated by year, month, and day. A time filter can be applied using a slider on the bottom of the visualization. The filter is then reproduced on all other cards. To undo the time filter, use the button “reset filters”.</li>
      <li><b>What does the colors mean?</b><br/>Color-coding varies according to the analytics. Language uses a standard categorical color scheme, and different colors are associated to different languages. Engagement shows the number of comments in grey, and how many of them were liked in blue. Sentiment discriminates between positive (green), neutral (dark grey), and negative (orange) comments. We also identify “Mixed” comments (purple) as those detected as both positive and negative by different automatic tools. Sentiment of non-English comments are not assessed, and these are colored in light grey. Finally, the word cloud and keyword lists in Topics are colored according to the overall sentiment of the comment they were extracted from.</li>
      <li><b>What does language mean?</b><br/>Language is classified with LangID, and it uses a standard categorical color scheme. Chart labels show languages in two-letter codes (ISO 639-1), and a caption at the bottom of the card shows the full name of the languages.</li>
      <li><b>Can I assess multiple videos with SAMBAVis at the same time?</b><br/>different icon, but behavior the same as a single video. However, a group of videos can have a large number of comments, which can take more time to load. Thus, a popup is displayed to confirm the selection of group of videos.</li>
